I am an EPSRC Innovation Fellow in the Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation ([ILCC](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc)), School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh. I have been working in the field of machine translation on many different sub-fields including reordering, evaluation, semantics, and spoken language translation. Our work on neural machine translation, for example using sub-word units and monolingual data, have lead to state-of-the-art models. I am also interested in multilingual dialogue and conversational analytics. More generally my goal is to understand how computational linguistics and machine learning can be combined to provide compelling NLP applications that improve people's lives. Most of my work is done in conjunction with the [STATMT](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/statmt) group, but I am also very lucky to collaborate with [Mark Steedman](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/steedman/), [Ivan Titov](http://ivan-titov.org/), and [Bea Alex](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/balex/) and the [LTG](https://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/) group.
